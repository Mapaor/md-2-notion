# md-2-notion
Simple website to import markdown content or files to your Notion pages.

You can find the webiste at: [md-2-notion.vercel.app](https://md-2-notion.vercel.app). The website does not store any data, your API key is completely safe (check de source code). However if safety is a big concern it is as simple as forking this repo and publishing your cloned repo to Vercel.

The thing is somehow you gotta use the notion api key if you want to edit notion pages. You can modify the code and use it as an environelnt variable for a more secure approach. This website is a demo of how easily you can *correctly* import markdown conent to Notion. (The official import function does quite a bad job).
